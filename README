For those counting, this is my third attempt at some sort of debate tool app, this time in Electron. C++ was a disaster (obviously) and Java with JavaFX was failing on portability (and was overall.. not great for other reasons that are my own fault). This app doesn't really do anything yet, but will have real time collaboration from the ground up, and will learn from the mistakes of the Java version at least.
